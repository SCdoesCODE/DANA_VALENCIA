# DANA_VALENCIA

Writing some thoughts here about the coordination during the DANA in Valencia and how it can be improved (e.g. with a more central platform to organise donations or help). Hopefully one can also learn how to be better prepared for the future with these observations.

The main purpose of this repo is to create some form of helpful tool for those affected in Valencia due to the DANA. We have been volunteering in different affected zones and there seems to be little to no coordination on e.g. the distribution of donations. Me and some other volunteers were in Catarroja e.g. yesterday and there were donated clothes in piles (becoming dirty from just being dumped on the ground) in the gas station. There are also different buildings that have turned into donation stations but there is no central platform where there is information about this. 

As a volunteer you also just walk to different affected areas - e.g. crossing the bridge from Valencia city to La Torre and from there you try to find somebody who either needs help or who can tell you where you can help. The further away you get from the city, the fewer volunteers you will find and also the most people that are in need of help. The access to these places is also very difficult and sometimes you have to choose alternative paths such as walking on the train tracks due to the road not being accesible. 

In one donation station where we were in Pedavi there were large trucks arriving with a lot of donations but there was a need to organise people to e.g. create a line of people that could carry the heavy boxes into the building. Inside of the building you also need people who can organise the different types of food or materials that is coming in. I was one of the people organising the donations inside the building and noticed that there was only one bag of glutenfree pasta coming in that we separated to the side. Throughout the day there was no more glutenfree items that we could put in that pile and it made me think about how there might be several people with celiac disease or other disorders in this particular zone that are in need of special food or medications and that it would be nice to have some sort of registry of that. 

Other things that are important are the materials used to clean the streets/houses such as brooms and shovels. Almost everytime we have been volunteering, we have left our brooms in places where we have been cleaning because usually there are other people there that need them for the next day. When we´re coming the next day we need to find new brooms and sometimes we have been walking quite far and realised that there is too little cleaning material at the place where we have arrived to help. As the days pass the water and mud also becomes more contaminated and it is important to stay safe with the use of e.g. masks, gloves or boots. It has been quite easy to get masks as there is pretty much just that one street that every volunteer crosses to get to the bridge to cross to La Torre (if that´s where you´re entering) and usually there is a table there where people are handing out masks (also bread, water, coffee etc). Boots have been quite hard to find but I have heard of stations where they hand them out. They were handing some boots out at La Torre but it was only for residents living in La Torre. 

There are also people coming with their cars and if you pass one of them they might ask you if you need anything - yesterday in Catarroja we were lucky to pass one of these cars and they gave us thick gloves and also whole suits which will be very helpful to stay dry while cleaning in the mud. There was also a nice person close to the Joaquin Sorolla station who asked us if we were going to La Torre and gave us (5 people) each a pair of waterproof work pants which was we appreciated very much. 

I wonder how safe it is that we are pushing so much muddy water down the drain of whichever street we are one. As the days pass (which have been quite warm also) the mud also gets thicker and dries up and instead of pushing it down the drain we gather it in piled outside the houses to be taken away by tractors (I assume). However I have still seen people push down quite thick mud down the drain so I wonder if this might cause some problems in the future. We were also helping out with clearing a basement (shared by some houses on a street) filled with water, mud and other materials. In the early hours we were just bringing up buckets with water, mud and other smaller things that had been sugmerged in the basement. After a while we were being handed (by the poeple wading through the water in the basement to fill the buckets for us who brought it outside the house to dump it across the street in a big pile) these large bricks which I later found out were part of a wall in the basement. I wonder how common this is among the other basements in houses affected and how dangerous this will be for the actual stability of the houses.
